# Date-Night :sparkling_heart:	

A Coop game where you need to work together in order to meet on the green platforms and pass the levels. The twist is that every platform you touch turns solid and into your color only allowing you to stand!

<p>I made the game in May 2020 as part of a two day coding challenge.</p>
<p>The game was created using the Unity2D engine :man_technologist:	.</p>
